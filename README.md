# SpotifyGenre-classification
Multi label classification of Spotify music

# Description
Multilabel classification of music genre using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Three different models are trained on processed data. Deep neural network seems to outperform randomforest classifier and logistic regression with chain mechanism. The overall test accuracy of DNN is 48% whereas test accuracy is 93%. Precision and recall is more than 65%.
